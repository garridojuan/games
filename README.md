# games
List of python scripts with functions that run for classic games. I am developing this scripts to improve my skills in python. The descrition of each game is below.

## Hangman
### Description
Classic game of chasing the word. I used a database of film titles in Spanish but of course any .txt file can be used. Each guess word (or group of words)
needs to be in a different row. The program selects a word from the database and the player has to pick letters. Each letter that is not included in the word counts as a mistake
and after a few mistakes (6 by default), you lose. Easy, like the old hangman. The program is interactive and each time is giving you feedback. 
### Further improvements 
I am thinking of adding a GUI with Tkinter in which you can see the hangman and the letters used, but this is a nice start. 

## Rock, paper, scissors
### Description
Very simple game. Rock wins scissors, scissors win paper and paper wins rock. Easy. You need to type what you choose and the program randomly picks another object and compares them
to see the winner and asks again for a rematch. 
### Further improvements
I do not think this game will require more improvements, maybe adding more objects to make it more complex and interesting, but I don't think I will do it.

NOTE: I will upload more games while I finish them.
